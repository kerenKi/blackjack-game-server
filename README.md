### What this project is about

This is a group project bulit during week 7 at Codaisseur academy.

Itâ€™s a classic game of blackjack meant for 2 players playing by turn from different computers.

* Each player can see his own cards but also the opponent's cards.
* On every turn, the player decides whether to draw another card or call and stay with the cards already on the table.
* At the end of the game, the winner will be the player with the cards that sum the closest to 21 without going over 21.
